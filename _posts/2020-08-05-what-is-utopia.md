Reading this [speech](http://unevenearth.org/2019/10/bookchin_doing_the_impossible/) by Murray Bookchin has inspired me to put words to the question of utopia.<!--more--> I think Bookchin is correct when he says that to be *utopian* is the most practical and rational option available. We might act and negotiate and rage, mending the many problems around us one by one, but without knowing our destination we can hardly plot a course. Like Archimedes without his fulcrum.

So without further ado, what are some things that my utopia looks like?

*My utopia is slow.* It's diverged from the frantic pace of modern life. It stepped off the Fordist assembly line, found a quiet corner in the back of the plant, and has taken a nap. Its citizens don't have to chase gigs to make ends meet. They work and play and create, and each can provide for their needs and their dependents, while still having ample spare time to enjoy life.

It's full of slow food. We've thought deeply about our food systems, and we have opted for gardens and organic food over industrial food _manufacture_ with intensive fossil fuel inputs. Farm workers are treated fairly like the essential humans they are. 

*My utopia is democratic.* It is accountable to the masses from top to bottom. In its political institutions it is multiracial and multiethnic, with protection and dignity enshrined for all persons. Policing and safety are understood as community endeavors, per Peel's notion that ["The police are the public and the public are the police."](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peelian_principles#Sir_Robert_Peel's_principles)

Democracy also pervades its industrial and economic systems. The management of organizations are decided democratically by labor, and "private property" is understood as stewardship of society's means of production. Managers cannot dispose of them at will. And just as trust may be granted democratically, it may also be repealed. The piling up of wealth is shunnedâ€”actually it is impossible.

*My utopia is global.* Democracy and goodwill spread across all nations and continents. Borders are meaningless, as there is no real reason for ordinary peoples to shun and fear one another. Indeed, the concept of the nation-state as a security guarantor is outmoded and obsolete. States have dismantled nuclear weapons, their armies, and their navies. 

Diplomacy is reoriented to a communitarian affair. Wherever there is the will to travel and see the world, citizens of the Earth can reach out to other communities, and share their cultures and goods with one another. Trade exists, then, but it is carried out in a way that respects the labor and land input into the product. The rapacious exploitation of human creative energies and of the land are relics of a barbarous past.

Our world and society are wildly out of balance. Defining a utopia is not an exercise in idleness, but rather an urgent necessity avoiding the mad abyss of climate crisis and authoritarianism we are rapidly hurtling towards. The human race edges ever closer to midnight, and more than ever needs a light to follow out of the darkness.

<h1 class="page-title">About</h1>

Hi, I'm Charlie. I'm a parent, engineer, and writer. I live in Austin, TX and Bozeman, MT. I love coyotes, hence the site title, and [invertebrates](https://www.xerces.org/).

I'm associated with various organizations and companies, but the opinions expressed here are entirely my own.

<h1 class="page-title">About</h1>

Hi, I'm Charlie. I'm a parent, engineer, and just-starting-out writer. I live in Austin, TX and Bozeman, MT. I like coyotes (an essay on that later), hence the site title, and am fascinated by the invertebrate world. 

I'm a associated with various organizations and companies, but the opinions expressed here are entirely my own.

# About

Hi, I'm Charlie (or Elle/Ellie, depending on the setting). I'm a parent, engineer, and just starting out writer. I live in Austin, TX and Bozeman, MT. I like coyotes (an essay on that later), hence the site title, and am a fan of the invertebrate world. I sometimes draw, and I exist on the continuously raging dumpster fire that is [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ledcoyote).

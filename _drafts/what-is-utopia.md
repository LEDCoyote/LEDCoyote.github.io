Reading this [speech](http://unevenearth.org/2019/10/bookchin_doing_the_impossible/) by Murray Bookchin has inspired me to put words to the question of Utopia.<!--more--> It is clear that our world is out of balance. This is true at all scales of human activity. At the grandest scale—the planetary—we are quickly running out of time to salvage what remains of the future habitability of the Earth. And at the tiniest, we are injecting practically all lifeforms in Earth with foreign chemistry and microscopic plastic particles, and we have few clues what cracks they introduce into the physical fabric of life.

Our social and technological spheres of existence are also wildly off-kilter. The technification of all things, as described by Bookchin, has done nothing but intensify. It's been enjoined by a madness in our mediascape and deepening precarity of health, food, and economy. The evils of racism have been given new life and, not creep, but barrel out of the shadows into the public square.

I could go on, cataloguing the many ills of the world, dissecting their development and emergence, but I scarcely have the energy to list even a few, let alone analyze them. All the evils of the Earth _are_, and though the arc of history bends, I know not which way.

> Futurism is the present as it exists today, projected, one hundred years from now. That’s what futurism is.

We might act and negotiate and rage, mending the many problems around us one by one, but without knowing our destination we can hardly plot a course. I think Bookchin is correct when he says that to be *utopian* is the most practical and rational thing to do. Action without ends is energy wasted. Emotion without focus is a pathway to despair.

My utopia is slow. It's diverged from the frantic pace of modern life. It stepped off the Fordist assembly line, found a quiet corner in the back of the plant, and is taking a nap.
